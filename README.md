# 📊 Subscription Tracker — Next.js + React + MongoDB + Docker

A simple **subscription tracking application** designed for a **single user** running on the same device.
Built with **React**, **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and containerized using **Docker**.

The app allows one-time authentication — once logged in, secure cookies keep the user permanently signed in on that device. No repeated logins required!

* Dashboard with useful insights:

  * Total active subscriptions
  * Most expensive subscription
  * Monthly cost overview
  * Yearly cost calculation
* Persistent lifetime login powered by cookies
